the comparison to the continuous wavelet transform method, and extensively
revised the manuscript with new sections and figures to describe our method
and results more thoroughly and clearly.

Response 1:

In this new version of the manuscript, Section 3.1 (Simulation of the SKA
images) has been rewritten to provide more details of the whole
simulations.

(1) We added the description on the sky map simulation of the foreground
components, which includes the Galactic synchrotron and free-free
emissions, extragalactic point sources, and radio haloes.  More simulation
details can be found in Wang et al. (2010).

(2) The SKA1-Low observation simulation from sky maps to 'observed' images
was described with more details.  We also added Figure 2 to present the
simulated images of the foreground emission and the EoR signal at 158 MHz.

(3) We simulated a second pair of image cubes (C2_eor, C2_fg) to be used as
the test set to evaluate the performance of the trained convolutional
denoising autoencoder (CDAE).  See also Response 2 below.

(4) We also clarified that no thermal noise was included in the
simulations.  See also Response 3 below.

Response 2:

In the old manuscript, only one pair of image cubes were simulated and were
randomly partitioned into the training, validation, and test sets.
Therefore, it was impossible to derive a complete image of the
reconstructed EoR signal.

In this new version, we have simulated a second pair of image cubes
(C2_eor, C2_fg) as the test set and thus we can obtain the image cube of
the reconstructed EoR signal.  Based on this, more results were added to
Section 3.3 (Training and results):

(1) The 158 MHz images of the input and reconstructed EoR signals were
shown in Figure 6;
(2) We further calculate the two-dimensional power spectra of the input and
reconstructed EoR signals and present the comparison in Figure 7.

Both results clearly show that the trained CDAE can accurately reconstruct
the EoR signal.

>   Did you include noise in your simulations?

Response 3:

Since the proposed method targets the tomographic EoR imaging, which are
very deep pointed observations that can reach a sufficiently low noise
level of ~< 1 mK (e.g., Mellema et al. 2013), we do not include thermal
noise in the simulations.  This has been clarified in the last paragraph of
Section 3.1 (Simulation of the SKA images).

Response 4:

Compared to classic denoising autoencoders, which use fully connected
layers (e.g., Vincent et al. 2008,2010), the CDAE uses multiple
convolutional layers to gain the powerful feature extraction capability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to improve its denoising performance
(e.g., Du et al. 2017).  Both the encoder and decoder parts of the CDAE
consist of multiple convolutional layers, and each convolutional layer
contains a number of filters and an activation function.  The pooling and
upsampling layers are not used in the proposed CDAE architecture because
they have very little impact on the performance.

In this new manuscript, Sections 2.1 (Convolutional denoising autoencoder)
and 2.2 (Network architecture) have been greatly expanded to describe the
CDAE and the architecture design more clearly and completely.  We have also
redrawn Figure 1 to illustrate the proposed CDAE architecture more
intuitively.

Response 5:

In order to explain how the CDAE learns, we have employed the occlusion
method to visualise the sensitivity distribution of the input data, i.e.,
the performance loss induced by the occlusion of a small part of the input
data (Zeiler & Fergus 2014).  We find that the derived sensitivity
distribution is more correlated with the EoR signal than the foreground
(Figure 8), which verifies that the CDAE has actually learned to
distinguish the EoR signal from the foreground emission.

Moreover, we have tracked the variations of sensitivity distribution and
its correlations to the EoR signal and the foreground emission along the
training process (Figure 9).  The tracking results suggest that the CDAE
first learns the major features of the EoR signal during the beginning
several (about 5) epochs and then it mainly learns the fine characteristic
of the EoR signal.

None the less, we note that a rigorously interpretation of the CDAE remains
a challenge and requires much more efforts.  A comprehensive understanding
of the CDAE is of great importance to further improve it and design more
efficient neural networks for practical EoR signal separation.  All the
contents have been added to the manuscript as the new Section 3.4 (How the
CDAE learns?).

Response 6:

Multiple foreground removal methods have been proposed and can be broadly
classified into the parametric ones (e.g., Wang et al. 2006; Liu et al.
2009b; Wang et al. 2013) and the non-parametric ones (e.g., Harker et al.
2009; Gu et al. 2013; Chapman et al. 2013; Mertens et al. 2018).  Besides
the polynomial fitting method, which is the representative method in the
parametric method category, we also consider the continuous wavelet
transform (CWT) method (Gu et al. 2013) among the non-parametric category
in this new manuscript.  The following two reasons are also considered in
choosing these two traditional methods:

(1) They both perform foreground removal along the frequency dimension
pixel-by-pixel, the same operation scheme as our method;
(2) They can give consistent and reliable results since they are intuitive
to implement and use.

Section 4.2 (Comparing to traditional methods) has been rewritten to
mention more traditional foreground removal methods and to justify the
selection of the polynomial fitting method and the CWT method for
comparison with our method.

Response 7:

We now write the full name "epoch of reionization" when the "EoR" acronym
is first used in the abstract.
