Authors' Responses
------------------

We gratefully thank the reviewer and the scientific editor for their
constructive comments that helped improve this manuscript.  Based on the
comments, we have refined the method, added more comparisons to traditional
methods, and extensively revised the manuscript with new sections and
figures.

The responses and explanations to their comments (indented with the ">"

We have extensively revised the manuscript as suggested by the reviewer and
the scientific editor.  Please refer to the following responses for the
revision details.

Section 3.1 has been rewritten to describe more details of the simulations,
including the sky maps of the foreground components and the EoR signal, the
synthesis imaging, as well as the image creation from the visibility data.
We also present the simulated images at 158 MHz (Figure 2 in the new
manuscript).

In this new version of the manuscript, we have added Figure 6 to show the
images (at 158 MHz) of the input and reconstructed EoR signal.  In
addition, we calculate the two-dimensional power spectra of the input and
reconstructed EoR signal and present the comparison in Figure 7.  To this
end, we have simulated another pair of image cubes for the foreground
emission and the EoR signal, which has been described in the third
paragraph of Section 3.1.

>   Did you include noise in your simulations?

We do not include thermal noise in the simulations since the proposed
method targets the EoR tomographic imaging, which will reach a sufficiently
low noise level (~< 1 mK).  This has been clarified in the last paragraph
of Section 3.1.

We have expanded Sections 2.1 and 2.2 to describe the convolutional
denoising autoencoder (CDAE) more clearly and completely.
Figure 1 has also been redrawn to illustrate the proposed CDAE more
intuitively.

We have added the new Section 3.4 to explain how the CDAE learns.  The
occlusion method is employed to visualise the sensitivity distribution in
the input data (Figure 8), which verifies that the CDAE has actually
learned to distinguish the EoR signal from the foreground emission.  By
tracking the variations of sensitivity distribution along the training
process, we gain some insights into how the CDAE learns the major and fine
features of the EoR signal (Figure 9).

None the less, we note that a rigorously interpretation of the CDAE remains
challenging and requires much further efforts.  A comprehensive
understanding of the CDAE is of great importance to further improve it and
craft more efficient neural networks for practical EoR signal separation.

TODO...

We now write the full name "epoch of reionization" when the "EoR" acronym
is first used in the abstract.
