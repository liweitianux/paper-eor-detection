Authors' Responses
------------------

We gratefully thank the reviewer for his/her time and useful comments that
help improve this manuscript.  Based on the comments, we have carefully
revised Section 2 to avoid conceptual repetitions to make the text more
succinct and coherent.  We have also updated Figure 3 and improved the
corresponding description to explain the results clearer.

The changes to the manuscript from the last revision are highlighted in
"magenta."  The point-by-point responses to the comments (indented with
the ">" mark) are listed below:

Response 1:

We have carefully revised Section 2 to avoid conceptual repetitions.
We have deleted redundant sentences and phrases, rewritten some text to be
more concise, and moved several sentences to make the description more
logic.  As a result, this section has become more succinct and coherent.

Response 2:

We have updated Figure 3 to present the example spectra of the foreground
emission and the EoR signal for one random sky pixel.  Therefore, the rapid
fluctuations generated by the beam effects are better illustrated and
compared to the EoR signal.

The main reason that the 'observed' foreground has an amplitude of about
two orders of magnitude smaller than the ideal foreground is that
interferometers are only sensitive to the spatial fluctuations of the
emission.  We have added this explanation to the end of paragraph 4 of
Section 3.1.
