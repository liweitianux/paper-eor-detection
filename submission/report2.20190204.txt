Comments to the Author
----------------------
In its current form, the manuscript can be accepted for publication. The
description of the methodology is now clear and comprehensive and the
additional tests valuable. Overall the paper provides exhaustive details
and guidelines to the reader.

The only additional requests from the reviewer are:

- Section 2 should be carefully checked for the English language trying
  also to avoid conceptual repetitions

- Figure 3 and the corresponding description on page 4 should be clarified.
  In particular the differences of orders of magnitude in the scales of the
  y axes in the two panels should be explained. Furthermore, how the
  fluctuations from the beam compares to those of the EoR signal, should be
  detailed.

Provided these two requests are fulfilled, the papers can be accepted with
no further reading by the reviewer.
