The revolutionary deep learning methods are rapidly developing and seeing
more and more applications in various fields of astronomy. However, there
are rare applications of deep learning methods in removing the strong
foreground contamination and separating the faint signal from the epoch
of reionization (EoR), which is one of the major challenges in the EoR
detection, given the complicated instrument effects. This work is a
pioneering attempt to deal with this challenge by employing the deep
learning methods, specifically the convolutional denoising autoencoder
(CDAE). We have demonstrated the proposed CDAE performed significantly
better than the traditional foreground removal methods (e.g., polynomial
fitting method), which exhibits the great potential of deep learning methods
in future EoR experiments. We therefore hope our work could benefit the
community as soon as possible.
