\begin{abstract}
When applying the foreground removal methods to uncover the faint EoR
signal, the foreground spectra are assumed to be smooth.
However, this assumption can be seriously violated in practice since
the unresolved or mis-subtracted foreground sources, which are further
complicated by the frequency-dependent beam effects of interferometers,
will generate significant fluctuations along the frequency dimension.
To address this issue, we propose a novel deep-learning-based method
that uses a 9-layer convolutional denoising autoencoder (CDAE) to
separate the EoR signal.
After being trained on the SKA images simulated with realistic beam
effects, the CDAE achieves excellent performance as the correlation
coefficient ($\rho$) between the reconstructed and input EoR signals
reaches \num{0.969 +- 0.020}.
In comparison, the traditional polynomial fitting method fails to
uncover the EoR signal ($\rho = \num{0.241 +- 0.103}$).
We conclude that, by hierarchically learning sophisticated features
through multiple convolutional layers, the CDAE is a powerful tool that
can be used to overcome the complicated frequency-dependent beam effects
and accurately separate the EoR signal, which exhibits the great
potential of deep-learning-based methods in future EoR experiments.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The \SI{21}{\cm} line emission of neutral hydrogen from the epoch of
reionization (EoR) is regarded as a decisive probe to directly explore
this stage (see \citealt{furlanetto2016rev} for a review).
To detect the \SI{21}{\cm} signal, which is believed to have been
redshifted to the frequencies below \SI{200}{\MHz}, low-frequency
radio interferometers such as the SKA \citep{koopmans2015rev} and its
pathfinders have been built or under construction.
The observational challenges, however, are immense due to
complicated instrumental effects, ionospheric distortions, radio frequency
interference, and the strong foreground contamination that
overwhelms the EoR signal by about \numrange{4}{5} orders of magnitude
(see \citealt{morales2010rev} for a review).
Fortunately, in the frequency dimension the foreground contamination
is expected to be intrinsically smooth, while the EoR signal fluctuates
rapidly on $\lesssim \si{\MHz}$ scales.
This difference is the key characteristic exploited by many
foreground removal methods in order to uncover the faint EoR signal,
including parametric fitting approaches
\citep[e.g.,][]{wang2006,liu2009fgrm,wang2013}
and non-parametric approaches
\citep[e.g.,][]{harker2009,chapman2013,mertens2018}.

However, the smoothness of the foreground spectra can be destroyed by
the frequency-dependent beam effects, i.e., the variation of the point
spread function (PSF) with frequencies that cannot be perfectly
calibrated \citep{liu2009ps}.
Because of the incomplete $uv$ coverage,
the PSF has a complicated profile consisting of a narrow peaky main lobe
and a multitude of jagged side lobes with relative amplitudes of about
\numrange{0.1}{1} per cent that extend beyond the field of view (FoV)
\citep[e.g.,][figures 1 and 3]{liu2009ps}.
A source that is unresolved or mis-subtracted (e.g., due to the limited
FoV) during the CLEAN process leaves catastrophic residuals,
the locations of which vary with the frequency since the angular
position of a PSF side lobe is inversely proportional to the frequency.
These effects lead to complicated residuals fluctuating along the
frequency dimension, which cannot be correctly separated from the EoR
signal by the traditional foreground removal methods that rely on
the smoothness of the foreground spectra.

Given the complicated profiles and frequency-dependent variations of
the PSF, it would be difficult to craft a practicable model for most,
if not all, existing foreground removal methods to overcome the beam
effects, even at the cost of extensive computation burden
\citep[e.g.,][]{lochner2015}.
Therefore deep-learning-based methods, which can distil knowledge from
the data to automatically refine the model, seem more feasible
and appealing \citep[e.g.,][]{herbel2018,vafaeiSadr2018}.
In recent years, the deep learning algorithms have seen prosperous
developments and have brought breakthroughs into many fields
(see \citealt{lecun2015} for a recent review).
Among various deep learning algorithms, the convolutional denoising
autoencoder (CDAE) and its variants are flexible and powerful in
learning subtle and complicated features from the data and have been
successfully applied to
weak gravitational wave signal denoising \citep[e.g.,][]{shen2017},
monaural audio source separation \citep[e.g.,][]{grais2017}, and so on.
These applications have demonstrated the outstanding abilities of the
CDAE in extracting weak signals from highly temporal-variable data,
thus it is worth trying to apply the CDAE to separate the EoR signal.
Although the signal-to-noise ratio in the EoR detection is much lower
than in existing applications, the EoR signal and foreground emission
as well as the beam effects are stationary or semi-stationary.

In this paper, a novel deep-learning-based method that uses a CDAE
is proposed to tackle the complicated frequency-dependent beam effects
and to separate the EoR signal along the frequency dimension.
In \autoref{sec:method}, we briefly introduce the CDAE and elaborate
the proposed method.
In \autoref{sec:experiments}, we demonstrate the performance of the
CDAE by applying it to the simulated SKA images.
We discuss the method and carry out a comparison to the traditional
polynomial fitting method in \autoref{sec:discussions}.
Finally, we summarise our work in \autoref{sec:summary}.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Convolutional denoising autoencoder}
\label{sec:cdae}

An autoencoder is composed of an encoder and a decoder, which can be
characterised by the functions $f(\cdot)$ and $g(\cdot)$, respectively.
The encoder maps the input $\B{x}$ to an internal code $\B{h}$, i.e.,
$\B{h} = f(\B{x})$, and the decoder tries to reconstruct the wanted
signal from the code $\B{h}$, i.e., $\B{r} = g(\B{h})$, where $\B{x}$,
$\B{h}$, and $\B{r}$ are all vectors for this work.
By placing constraints (e.g., dimensionality, sparsity) on the
internal code $\B{h}$ and training the autoencoder to minimize the
loss $L(\B{r}, \, \B{x})$, which quantifies the difference between the
reconstruction $\B{r}$ and the input $\B{x}$, the autoencoder tries to
learn the codes that effectively represent the input data
\citep[e.g.,][chapter 14]{goodfellow2016}.

\editwip{%
In order to make the autoencoder learn good representations of the input
data instead of simply copying the input as the output,
\citet{vincent2008,vincent2010} proposed to apply the denoising criterion,
which states that `a good representation is one that can be obtained
robustly from a corrupted input and that will be useful for recovering the
corresponding clear input.'
The input data are artificially corrupted (e.g., by adding noise) and the
autoencoder is trained to reconstruct the original clean input for the
purpose of learning robust features from the input data.
In addition, the trained autoencoder can be employed to denoise the data
\citep[e.g.,][]{xie2012,gondara2016}, hence being called a `denoising
autoencoder.'

Classic autoencoders use fully connected layers and thus have a large
number of parameters, which are harder to train and prevent from build
deeper and more powerful autoencoders
\citep[e.g.,][]{glorot2010,larochelle2009}.
On the other hand, convolutional layers as used in convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have much fewer parameters and can better exploit the local
features in data.  Therefore it is easier and more intuitive to stack
multiple convolutional layers to build highly expressive CNNs that achieve
outstanding performance in image classification and relevant fields
\citep[e.g.,][]{krizhevsky2012,simonyan2014,szegedy2015}.
By utilizing multiple convolutional layers instead of fully connected
layers in a denoising autoencoder, the resulting CDAE gains the similar
capability of CNNs to fully exploit the complicated features in the data
(e.g., the subtle differences between the EoR signal and foreground
emission when interlaced with the beam effects), which may greatly improve
the denoising ability and can reconstruct even seriously corrupted signal
\citep{du2017}.}  % editwip
Consequently, the CDAE is well suited to separate the faint EoR signal
$\B{x}_{\R{EoR}}$ from the strong foreground emission $\B{x}_{\R{fg}}$,
which is regarded as the noise, by denoising the input total emission
($\B{x} = \B{x}_{\R{EoR}} + \B{x}_{\R{fg}}$).


%%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Network architecture}
\label{sec:architecture}

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{network-crop}
  \caption{\label{fig:network}%
    [TODO]
    The network architecture of the proposed CDAE, consisting of a
    4-layer encoder (the orange boxes), a 4-layer decoder (the blue
    boxes), and one output layer (the green box).
    The layers in the encoder and decoder use the ELU activation
    function and batch normalisation (BN), while the output layer uses
    the `tanh' activation function.
    All filters are vectors of length 3 and the numbers of filters in
    each layer are marked in parentheses.
  }
\end{figure*}

\editwip{%
The CDAE consists of multiple convolutional layers with each layer
containing a number of filters and an activation function.
Each filter is convolved with the output of the previous layer and the
convolution result then goes through the activation function to produce
the output of this layer.
Because the CDAE output $\B{r}$, which has the same size as the input
$\B{x}$, is a vector of length $n_f$ with $n_f$ being the number of
frequency channels in the image cube (see also \autoref{sec:simulation}),
the last convolutional layer (i.e., the output layer) has only one filter.
The remaining convolutional layers can be divided into the encoder and
decoder parts.
The number of layers in the encoder and decoder as well as the number of
filters in each layer are hyperparameters of the CDAE.

We adopt filters of size 3 in all layers, and use the hyperbolic tangent
function (i.e., tanh; see also \autoref{sec:preprocessing}) and the
exponential linear unit \citep{clevert2016} as activation functions for the
output layer and other layers, respectively.
The batch normalisation is applied to all layers except for the output
layer to improve the training process as well as to act as a regularizer
to prevent overfitting \citep{ioffe2015}.

We have followed common practices \citep[e.g.,][]{suganuma2018,geron2017}
to build multiple CDAE architectures, each containing a different number of
layers and filters.
After evaluating their performances (see also \autoref{sec:training}),} % editwip
the simplest one with sufficiently good performance is selected,
which consists of a 4-layer encoder with $(32,64,64,32)$ filters,
a 4-layer decoder with $(32,64,64,32)$ filters, and one output layer,
as illustrated in \autoref{fig:network}.
\editwip{%
We have also tested to use pairs of pooling and upsampling layers in the
CDAE, but it has very little impacts on the performance.
Moreover, we focus on the feature extraction and denoising abilities of the
CDAE rather than the specific formats of the internal codes.
Thus it is reasonable to not use pooling and upsampling layers, which also
eases the explanation of how the CDAE learns (\autoref{sec:explanation}).
}


%%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Training and evaluation}
\label{sec:train-eval}

The CDAE is initialised by the He uniform initialiser \citep{he2015}
and is trained by using the Adam optimisation method \citep{kingma2015}.
The loss, which describes the difference between the reconstructed EoR
signal $\B{r}_{\R{EoR}}$ and the input EoR signal $\B{x}_{\R{EoR}}$,
is calculated as the mean squared error (MSE), i.e.,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:loss}
  L = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}
    \left[ \B{r}_{\R{EoR}}^{(i)} - \B{x}_{\R{EoR}}^{(i)} \right]^T
    \left[ \B{r}_{\R{EoR}}^{(i)} - \B{x}_{\R{EoR}}^{(i)} \right],
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of data points in the training dataset.
By being trained to minimize the loss $L$, the CDAE learns to
reconstruct the EoR signal from the input data $\B{x}$.

To evaluate the performance of the CDAE in separating the EoR signal,
the commonly used Pearson's correlation coefficient
\citep[e.g.,][]{harker2009,chapman2013}
is adopted to measure the similarity between the reconstructed EoR
signal $\B{r}_{\R{EoR}}$ and the input EoR signal $\B{x}_{\R{EoR}}$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:corrcoef}
  \rho = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^{n}(r_{\R{EoR},j} - \bar{r}_{\R{EoR}})
      (x_{\R{EoR},j} - \bar{x}_{\R{EoR}})}{
        \sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{n}(r_{\R{EoR},j} - \bar{r}_{\R{EoR}})^2
          \sum_{j=1}^{n}(x_{\R{EoR},j} - \bar{x}_{\R{EoR}})^2}
    },
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the length of the signals,
and $\bar{r}_{\R{EoR}}$ and $\bar{x}_{\R{EoR}}$ represent the mean values.
The closer the correlation coefficient is to one, the better the
performance of separation.

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:experiments}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Simulation of the SKA images}
\label{sec:simulation}

We carry out end-to-end simulations to generate the SKA images to
train the proposed CDAE and evaluate its performance.
\editwip{%
An \SI{8}{\MHz} frequency band centred at \SI{158}{\MHz} is chosen as
an example and is divided into $n_f = 101$ channels with a resolution of
\SI{80}{\kHz}.
At each frequency, the sky maps of the foreground emission and the EoR
signal are simulated within an area of \SI{10 x 10}{\degree} and are
pixelized into \num{1800 x 1800} with a pixel size of \SI{20}{\arcsecond}.
For the foreground emission, we take into account the contributions from
the Galactic synchrotron and free-free radiations, extragalactic point
sources, and radio haloes.
The Galactic synchrotron radiation is simulated by extrapolating the Haslam
\SI{408}{\MHz} map with a power-law spectrum.  We make use of the
reprocessed Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map\footnote{%
  The reprocessed Haslam \SI{408}{\MHz} map:
  \url{http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/research/cosmos/haslam_map/}}
\citep{remazeilles2015} as the template, and the synchrotron spectral index
map made by \citet{giardino2002} to account for the index variation with
sky positions.
By employing the tight relation between the H$\alpha$ and free-free
emissions \citep[see][and references therein]{dickinson2003}, the Galactic
free-free radiation can be derived from the H$\alpha$ survey map
\citep{finkbeiner2003}.
Since the Galactic diffuse emissions vary remarkably across the sky, we
simulate them at a central position of (R.A., Dec\@.) = (\SI{0}{\degree},
\SI{-27}{\degree}), which has a high galactic latitude
($b = \SI{-78.5}{\degree}$) and thus is expected to be appropriate for
EoR observations.
We account for the following 5 types of extragalactic point sources:
(1) star-forming and starburst galaxies, (2) radio-quiet active galactic
nuclei (AGNs), (3) Fanaroff-Riley type I and type II AGNs, (4) GHz-peaked
spectrum AGNs, and (5) compact steep spectrum AGNs.
The former three types of sources are simulated by utilizing the results
published by \citet{wilman2008} and the latter two types are simulated by
employing their corresponding luminosity functions and spectral models.
Similar to the real-time peeling of the brightest point sources in
practical data analysis pipelines \citep[e.g.,][]{mitchell2008,intema2009},
we assume that sources with a \SI{158}{\MHz} flux density
$S_{158} > \SI{10}{\mJy}$ have been removed \citep[e.g.,][]{liu2009ps}.
The radio haloes are simulated by generating a sample of galaxy clusters
with the Press-Schechter formalism \citep{press1974} and then applying
multiple scaling relations (e.g., between cluster mass and X-ray
temperature, between X-ray temperature and radio power) to derive their
radio emissions.
More details regarding to the simulation of these foreground components can
be found in our previous work \citep{wang2010} and references therein.
For simulating the sky maps of the EoR signal, we take advantage of the
2016 data release from the Evolution Of 21\,cm Structure project\footnote{%
  The Evolution Of 21\,cm Structure project:
  \url{http://homepage.sns.it/mesinger/EOS.html}}
\citep{mesinger2016} and extract the image slices at needed redshifts
(i.e., frequencies) from the light-cone cubes of the recommended `faint
galaxies' case.

\begin{figure*}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{obsimg-158}
  \caption{\label{fig:obsimg}%
    Simulated images of the EoR signal (left panel) and the foreground
    emission (right panel) at \SI{158}{\MHz}.
    Both images have a size of \num{360 x 360} and cover a sky area of
    \SI{2 x 2}{\degree}.
    The blobs in the right panel show the bright point sources and radio
    haloes.
  }
\end{figure*}

To fully incorporate realistic frequency-dependent beam effects into the
simulated sky images, we further adopt the SKA1-Low layout
configuration\footnote{\raggedright%
  SKA1-Low layout:
  \url{https://astronomers.skatelescope.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/SKA-TEL-SKO-0000422_02_SKA1_LowConfigurationCoordinates-1.pdf}}
to simulate instrument observations.
For each sky image, we employ the SKA1-Low layout in the
\textsc{oskar}\footnote{%
  OSKAR: \url{https://github.com/OxfordSKA/OSKAR} (version 2.7.0)}
simulator \citep{mort2010} to perform an observation of \SI{6}{\hour}
integration time, yielding the visibility data, from which the `observed'
image is created by the \textsc{wsclean}\footnote{%
  WSClean: \url{https://sourceforge.net/p/wsclean} (version 2.5)}
imager \citep{offringa2014}.
In order to emphasize the faint and relatively diffuse EoR signal, the
natural weighting and only baselines of \numrange{30}{1000} wavelengths are
utilized in the imaging process.} % editwip
Finally, the created images are cropped to keep only the central
\SI{2 x 2}{\degree} regions (i.e., \num{360 x 360} pixels) for the
purpose of the best quality.
Therefore, we obtain \editwip{a pair of} image cubes of size
\num{360 x 360 x 101} for the EoR signal ($C_{\R{EoR}}^{(1)}$) and the
foreground emission ($C_{\R{fg}}^{(1)}$), respectively
\editwip{%
(see \autoref{fig:obsimg} for the simulated images at \SI{158}{\MHz}).
To better illustrate the impacts of beam effects on the foreground spectra,
we take one sky pixel as an example and show its spectra and the
corresponding differential spectra with and without the beam effects
integrated (\autoref{fig:simudata}).} % editwip
As it clearly shows, when the beam effects are considered, the smoothness
of the foreground spectrum is seriously damaged by the significant
fluctuations with strength of about \SI{10}{\mK} (the bottom panel).

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\myfigwidth]{simudata}
  \caption{\label{fig:simudata}%
    Example spectra (the bold blue lines) and the corresponding
    differential spectra (the thin red lines) for the foreground
    emission of one sky pixel.
    The top and bottom panels show the cases without and with
    instrument observation, respectively.
  }
\end{figure}

\editwip{%
It is beneficial to simulate two pairs of image cubes, which are used to
train and evaluate the CDAE, respectively.
With the availability of a complete pair of image cubes for evaluation,
the performance of the CDAE can be presented more intuitively with the
images and power spectra of the separated EoR signal (see
\autoref{sec:training}).
To obtain another pair of image cubes, we simulate the Galactic diffuse
emissions at a central coordinate of (R.A., Dec\@.) = (\SI{3}{\degree},
\SI{-27}{\degree}), i.e., \SI{3}{\degree} from the above pair of image
cubes, which is sufficient because the images are only \SI{2 x 2}{\degree}
in size.
Since extragalactic point sources, radio haloes, and the EoR signal are
mostly isotropic, we shift their sky maps simulated above by
\SI{3}{\degree} to generate the maps for use here.
Following the same procedures to simulate instrument observations, we
obtain the second pair of image cubes ($C_{\R{EoR}}^{(2)}$,
$C_{\R{fg}}^{(2)}$).

We note that the simulations do not include thermal noise because the
proposed method is currently designed to create tomographic EoR images
from very deep observations that have sufficiently low noise.
For example, SKA1-Low is expected to perform EoR imaging observations of
\SI{1000}{\hour} per pointing, reaching an unprecedented image noise level
of $\lesssim \SI{1}{\mK}$ \citep[e.g.,][]{mellema2013rev,koopmans2015rev}.
} % editwip


%%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Data preprocessing}
\label{sec:preprocessing}

The dataset $S = \{(\B{x}, \,\B{x}_{\R{EoR}})\}$ for the CDAE is derived
from the simulated image cubes $C_{\R{EoR}}$ and $C_{\R{fg}}$, each data
point $(\B{x} = \B{x}_{\R{EoR}} + \B{x}_{\R{fg}}, \,\B{x}_{\R{EoR}})$
representing the total emission and the EoR signal of one sky pixel,
respectively.
The dataset thus consists of $N = \num{360x360} = \num{129600}$ data points.

For the input data $X = \{\B{x}\}$, we propose to apply the
Fourier Transform (FT) along the frequency dimension,
which makes the EoR signal more distinguishable from the
foreground emission and thus easier to be learned by the CDAE
(a comparison with the results derived without applying the FT is
presented in \autoref{sec:why-ft}).
The Blackman-Nuttall window function is applied to suppress the
FT side-lobes caused by the sharp discontinuities at both ends
of the finite frequency band \citep[e.g.,][]{chapman2016}.
It is sufficient to keep only half the Fourier coefficients because
$\B{x}$ is real, thus $\B{x}$ of length $n_f = 101$ is transformed to
be 51 complex Fourier coefficients, among which the $n_{\R{ex}}$
coefficients of the lowest Fourier frequencies are excised since they
are mostly contributed by the spectral-smooth foreground emission.
We adopt $n_{\R{ex}} = 6$ to achieve a balance between the foreground
suppression and the loss of the EoR signal.
The real and imaginary parts of the remaining 45 complex coefficients
are then concatenated into a new real vector of length 90, since the CDAE
requires real data.
Finally, the data are zero-centred and normalised to have unit variance.

The preprocessing steps for the input EoR signal
$X_{\R{EoR}} = \{\B{x}_{\R{EoR}}\}$
are basically the same except for minor adjustments.
After applying the FT, excising the $n_{\R{ex}}$ lowest Fourier
components, and concatenating the real and imaginary parts,
the data elements that have a value less than the 1$^{\R{st}}$
percentile or greater than the 99$^{\R{th}}$ percentile are truncated,
in order to prevent the possible outliers hindering the training of
the CDAE.
Finally, the value range of the data is scaled to be $[-1, 1]$ by
dividing by the maximum absolute value,
which allows to use the `tanh' activation function whose value range
is also $[-1, 1]$ in the output layer of the CDAE
(\autoref{sec:architecture}).

\subsection{Training and results}
\label{sec:training}

The preprocessed dataset is randomly partitioned into
the training set ($S_{\R{tr}}$; 60 per cent) to fit the weights of
filters by minimizing the loss $L$,
the validation set ($S_{\R{val}}$; 20 per cent) to determine the
hyperparameters (e.g., the number of layers and filters, the choice of
loss function),
and the test set ($S_{\R{test}}$; 20 per cent) that is employed to
evaluate the performance of the trained CDAE.

We implement the proposed CDAE using the popular \textsc{Keras}\footnote{%
  Keras: \url{https://keras.io} (version 2.2.0)}
framework \citep{keras} with the \textsc{TensorFlow}\footnote{%
TensorFlow: \url{https://www.tensorflow.org} (version 1.4.1)}
back end \citep{tensorflow}.
The parameters of the Adam optimisation method are set to the default
values (learning rate $\alpha = 0.001$, exponential decay rates for the
first moment estimates $\beta_1 = 0.9$ and for the second moment
estimates $\beta_2 = 0.999$; \citealt{kingma2015}).
The CDAE is trained on the training set ($S_{\R{tr}}$) with a batch size
of 100 for 100 epochs until the training loss converges.

The training and validation losses together with the evaluation index
(i.e., the correlation coefficient $\rho$) calculated on the validation set
($S_{\R{val}}$) during the training phase are shown in \autoref{fig:train}.
The steadily decreasing losses and increasing correlation coefficient
suggest that the CDAE is well trained without overfitting.
The evaluation on the test set ($S_{\R{test}}$) demonstrates that the
trained CDAE achieves excellent performance with a correlation
coefficient of $\rho_{\R{CDAE}} = \num{0.969 +- 0.020}$.
As an example, \autoref{fig:result} illustrates the reconstructed EoR
signal ($\rho = 0.965$) for one random pixel.
In addition, we calculate the one-dimensional power spectra for each
pixel in $S_{\R{test}}$ \citep[e.g.,][]{chapman2013}
and find that the reconstructed EoR signal can recover the total power
to a fraction of $R_{\R{CDAE}} = \num{90.1 +- 8.9}$ per cent.

The achieved excellent performance of the CDAE can be mainly attributed
to the architecture of stacking multiple convolutional layers, which
implements a powerful feature extraction technique by hierarchically
combining the basic features learned in each layer to build more and
more sophisticated features \citep{lecun2015}.
Combined with the flexibility provided by the \num{54337} trainable
weights, the CDAE, after being well trained, can intelligently learn a
model that is optimised to accurately separate the faint EoR signal
\citep[e.g.,][]{domingos2012}.

\section{Discussions}
\label{sec:discussions}

%%----------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Why preprocess the dataset with Fourier Transform?}
\label{sec:why-ft}

We have performed another experiment using the same CDAE architecture,
dataset, and data preprocessing steps, except for applying the FT
as depicted in \autoref{sec:preprocessing}.
After training the CDAE in the same way as described in
\autoref{sec:training}, the achieved performance is
$\rho_{\R{noFT}} = \num{0.927 +- 0.051}$, which is smaller and has a
larger uncertainty than the case with FT applied, indicating a worse
performance.
We also find that the training process is slightly unstable given the
small spikes on the curves of both the training loss and the correlation
coefficient, and the training loss converges more slowly,
as presented in \autoref{fig:train-noft}.
These indicate that it is beneficial to preprocess the
dataset by applying the FT along the frequency dimension, because the
EoR signal and the foreground emission become more distinguishable
in the Fourier domain, where the fluctuating EoR signal concentrates on
larger Fourier modes while the spectral-smooth foreground emission
distributes mainly on smaller Fourier modes \citep[e.g.,][]{parsons2012}.

    Same as \autoref{fig:train} but for the case that the data are

\subsection{Comparing to the polynomial fitting method}
\label{sec:polyfit}

In order to further demonstrate the performance of our method, we have
carried out a comparison between our method and the traditional polynomial
fitting method \citep[e.g.,][]{wang2006,liu2009ps}.
Using the same image cubes simulated in \autoref{sec:simulation},
a low-degree polynomial is fitted along the frequency dimension for each
sky pixel in the image cube of the total emission (i.e.,
$C_{\R{tot}} = C_{\R{EoR}} + C_{\R{fg}}$).
Then by subtracting the fitted smooth component, which is regarded as
the foreground emission, the EoR signal is expected to be uncovered.
We have tested polynomials of the degree from 2 (quadratic) to
5 (quintic), and find that the quartic polynomial (degree of 4)
can give the best result.
However, the correlation coefficient calculated for the separated EoR
signal in such a case is only $\rho_{\R{poly}} = \num{0.241 +- 0.103}$,
which indicates that the polynomial fitting method
performs poorly in removing the foreground emission.
As illustrated in \autoref{fig:simudata}(b), the frequency-dependent
beam effects cause significant fluctuations, which can be even stronger
than the EoR signal, on the originally smooth foreground spectra.
The polynomial fitting method, which can only model the smooth
spectrum, is unable to distinguish these rapid fluctuations from the
EoR signal, hence leading to inferior results.
On the contrary, given its flexibility and data-driven nature,
the CDAE can distil knowledge from the data to optimise itself for
the EoR signal separation and hence achieve superior performance.


%%======================================================================
\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The frequency-dependent beam effects of interferometers can cause
rapid fluctuations along the frequency dimension,
which destroy the smoothness of the foreground spectra and prevent
traditional foreground removal methods from uncovering the EoR signal.
Given the difficulties in crafting practicable models to overcome the
complicated beam effects, methods that can intelligently learn tailored
models from the data seem more feasible and appealing.
To this end, we have proposed a deep-learning-based method that uses
a 9-layer CDAE to separate the EoR signal.
The CDAE has been trained on the simulated SKA images and has achieved
excellent performance.
We conclude that the CDAE has outstanding ability to overcome the
complicated beam effects and accurately separate the faint EoR signal,
exhibiting the great potential of deep-learning-based methods
to play an important role in the forthcoming EoR experiments.
